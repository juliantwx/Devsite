      "Julian was a very friendly and helpful individual who went above and beyond in the delivery of my project. His codes were clean and efficient with useful and easy-to-understand comments. Not only did he complete my requests well within the agreed upon timeline, he also (with my permission) helped rewrite some of my existing code to make it more efficient. As he understood that I was a beginner, he even wrote up a document compiling all his inputs and elaborated on them to help better my understanding, which was extremely useful. He communicated clearly with super quick responses and understood my project needs. Overall, I am very satisfied with Julian's work and would definitely recommend him!",
